# Tree Intersection

## Credit

Worked on this with Tyler Main

## Challenge

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
- Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

Utilized the Single-responsibility principle: methods are clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge.

- Big O for this problem is time: O(n) space: O(n)

## API

### _treeSet

Helper function using Binary tree and hash table methods.

### _treeCheck

Helper function using Binary tree and hash table methods.
