# stack-and-queue

## Challenge

- Extending an Implementation
- Implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency

Worked on this assignment with Taylor Main.
Big O for this problem is time: O(n) space: O(1)

## API

### Stack

### push

- Arguments: value
- Adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

### pop

- Arguments: none
- Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
- Removes the node from the top of the stack
- Should raise exception when called on empty stack

### peek

- Arguments: none
- Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
- Should raise exception when called on empty stack

### Is empty

- Arguments: none
- Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

### Queue

### Enqueue

- Arguments: none
- Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
- Removes the node from the front of the queue
- Should raise exception when called on empty queue

### dequeue

- Arguments: none
- Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
- Removes the node from the front of the queue
- Should raise exception when called on empty queue

### Peek

- Arguments: none
- Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
- Should raise exception when called on empty stack

### Is Empty

- Arguments: none
- Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty
