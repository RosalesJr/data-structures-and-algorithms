## Approach & Efficiency

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Big O for this problem is time: O(n) space: O(1)

## API

### Binary Tree

- pre order
- in order
- post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

### Binary Search Tree

### Add

- Arguments: value
- Return: nothing
- Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.

### Contains

- Argument: value
- Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
